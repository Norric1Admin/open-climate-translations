## Goal icons

Icons for the 17 goals of the SDGs include some language, and so they are provided here, in both full-color and high-contrast versions. They can be downloaded using these patterns:

Full-color:
```

```
High-contrast:
```
https://norric1admin.github.io/open-climate-translations/assets/img/high-contrast/goals/[language]/[number].png
```

Feel free to use these images directly from these URLs, to avoid having to download and maintain them in your platform.

## Examples

For example, the French icons for Goal 6 would be:

<img alt="Goal 6" src="https://norric1admin.github.io/open-climate-translations/assets/img/goals/fr/6.png" />

```

```

<img alt="Goal 6 - High Contrast" src="https:///norric1admin.github.io/open-climate-translations/assets/img/high-contrast/goals/fr/6.png" />

```

## Goal 18

Icons for "Goal 18" are included as well, as these are often used to complete a full symmetrical grid of icons.
